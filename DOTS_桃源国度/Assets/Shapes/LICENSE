Legal TLDR: Treat Shapes like a commercial product you license through my Patreon, on a pay-what-you-want-but-at-least $10 basis,
with further support very much encouraged, but not required for those who can't~

ðŸ’”	Shapes is not open source, but if my patreon support grows substantially, it would likely open source under the MIT license
ðŸ’”	You may not sell, publish or distribute the source code or any modifications thereof in any circumstance
ðŸ’”	You may not distribute the code in open-source projects or asset store plugins
ðŸ’”	You may not port the source code to other engines and release it as your own, that's super rude :c

ðŸ’š	You may use Shapes in projects developed in Unity, both commercial and non-commercial
ðŸ’š	You technically don't have to keep up a subscription on my Patreon beyond the first $10,
	partially because I literally can't enforce it, but mostly because I think, if you don't have a lot of money,
	it's totally understandable if you can't do it, even though I do think it's worth at least $40!
	However, if you can afford to support further, I would very very much appreciate it, this is my main source of income,
	and I work very hard to give valuable stuff to the community as a whole!
ðŸ’š 	If your business entity can't license Shapes through Patreon for legal reasons, contact me at acegikmo@gmail.com
ðŸ’š 	It's not required but, it'd be really nice if you could credit me for Shapes in your project!
ðŸ’š 	Finally - please tag me (@FreyaHolmer) if you share your work on twitter - I'd love to see all the cool stuff you create!!
