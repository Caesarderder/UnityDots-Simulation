## Shapes

A GPU-based real-time vector graphics library for Unity by [Freya HolmÃ©r](http://twitter.com/FreyaHolmer).

Shapes will let you draw high-quality vector graphics such as lines, polylines, discs, rings, spheres, and other primitives, many of which with an infinite resolution, achieved using ~~witchcraft~~ shader math, rather than relying on high-resolution textures or a high polygon density.

Essentially - I got tired of how Unity was lacking in drawing vector primitives, and yet these things were ubiquitous in 2D environments like html5 canvas. I basically just wanted that, without having to leave Unity and C# because they're so neat~ and who uses javascript gosh
