IMPORTANT NOTES
- Mathematics (com.unity.mathematics) package will be installed automatically as a dependency.
- The new Erosion Tool is heavily relying on Compute Shader, so please make sure your target platform support compute shader. If you only want to use the Erosion Tool in the editor, then Window with DX11/DX12 and Shader Model 5.0 GPU, and MacOS with Metal API will work.
- 2 layers are preserved for the asset to work: POLARIS RAYCAST and POLARIS SPLINE. Their layer index can be changed in the Editor Settings to prevent conflict with other assets.
NEW FEATURES
- Erosion Tool: Create natural looking terrain by running Hydraulic and Thermal Erosion using compute shaders on the terrain, then use the simulation data for texturing. This tool is fully compatible with the multi-terrains workflow as well as the Live Preview and Backup system.
- Conditional Painting: Now you can use height rule, slope rule and noise rule to efficiently paint on the terrains. Support Albedo, Metallic, Smoothness, Mask and Splat painter.
- Merge UV option: Map the UV coordinates to the exact center point of the triangle, so you can easily have sharp color using the Albedo map. This option can also be used to achieve more interesting stylized look with other shading mode, while saving some mesh data by not using vertex color channel.
- Triangle sampler: Now you can sample the exact color of the terrain Albedo/Metallic map when using the Geometry-Texture Painter. The target texture will be determined depends on you paint mode (Albedo map in Albedo mode, Metallic map in Metallic/Smoothness mode).
IMPROVEMENTS
- Adding support for Unity 2021.
- UI/UX improvements: Adding tooltips for every field in the inspector of many components, including: Wizard Window, Terrain Inspector, Geometry-Texture Painter, Foliage Painter, Object Painter, Spline Creator, most Spline Modifier, Geometry Stamper, Texture Stamper, Foliage Stamper, Object Stamper, more to come in future updates.
- UI/UX improvements: Adding total world size to the Wizard window.
- UI/UX improvements: Many components have UI redesign.
- UI/UX improvements: Embedding asset Editor Settings and Runtime Settings into the Project Settings window.
- Avoid creating terrain textures if not needed, a dummy texture will be returned for read-only actions such as Live Preview.
- Prevent terrain mesh from being embedded in the scene in Geometry.GenerateOnEnable mode.
- Terrain Data: Adding Job/Burst support for AddGrassInstances function.
- Main Terrain Component: A lot faster tree/grass position snapping with Jobs/Burst and Raycast Command. Preserve a layer for internal raycasting, this layer will be setup automatically when selecting the Stylized Terrain component. Raycast layer index can be changed in Editor settings to prevent conflict with other assets.
- Spline Tool: Generate mesh for each spline segment and use that mesh to perform modifier's action (instead of calling GL and sending vertex by vertex). Optimize spline gizmos.
- Spline Tool: Preserve a layer for internal spline rendering, this layer will be setup automatically when selecting the Spline Creator. Spline layer index can be changed in Editor Settings to prevent conflict with other assets.
- Spline Tool: Adding Jobs/Burst support for Foliage Spawner, Foliage Remover, Object Spawner.
- Spline Tool: Spline modifiers has new clean and organized UI.
- Spline Tool: A lot faster sweeptest with Jobs/Burst, testing on terrain and chunks level.
- Paint Tools: Perform Quad-Rect test for culling, instead of the old Rect-Rect method.
- Stamp Tools: Perform Quad-Rect test for culling, faster Live Preview.
- Stamp Tools: Adding Jobs/Burst support for Foliage Stamper, Object Stamper.
- Stamp Tools: Now you can reorder the stamp layers of Foliage/Object Stamper.
- Group Tool: Adding Mask Override.
- Mesh Generation: Better XZ-displacement.
- Rendering: Adding "Grass Cull Bias" to prevent grass popping.
- Adding a Show Terrain Mask option to toggle terrain mask rendering, to reduce editor lag.
- Many performance optimizations.
FIXES
- Fix height map being broke after changing its resolution.
- Fix native array bug with runtime generation.
- Stampers: Fix clipped mask issue on very steep angles. 
- Fix Prototype Group not saved in the editor.
- Many minor fixes.
DEPRECATIONS
- Dropdown style paint mode selector is deprecated.
