    question: What is the different between Polaris and other low poly terrain tools?
    answer: "Different from other stylized terrain engine, Polaris is the first one
      which support for multi-terrains editing, empowered by GPU technologies, providing
      the smoothest experience. It also give you the most flexible workflow by combining
      the traditional sculpting or the modern procedural method, or somewhere in
      between.\r"

    question: Getting started with Polaris V2.
    answer: 'Polaris terrains consist of 2 main parts, the terrain component and
      the terrain data container, where the terrain component responsible for generate
      geometry, assign material properties, render trees, etc.

      Terrain tools
      are built separately from the terrain component, including: Group Tool, Paint
      Tool, Stamp Tool, Spline Tool, etc.

      It support for a wide variety of
      shading styles, so set up material correctly is very important for some terrain
      tools to work! The Wizard can do this automatically when you create your terrain.

      In
      order to support for multi-terrains editing, some properties like Splat textures
      and Foliage prototypes are stored as separate assets instead of bounding to
      a single terrain.'

    question: How to save some storage memory of Terrain Data?
    answer: 'It is important to optimize your memory usage. For Terrain Data, you
      can save some megabytes by reducing the resolution of unused maps.

      For
      example, if your shading model is Lambert Gradient Lookup, then the following
      map maybe unused:

      - Metallic Map

      - Splat Control Maps

      Set
      the resolution of these maps to its lowest value (32).

      Furthermore,
      instead of having a super high resolution of height map, such as 4k, which
      doesn''t make sense with low poly, we can reduce it to somewhere around 512
      or 1024.'

      - RG: normalized height value, encoded.
